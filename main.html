	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with efficient time complexity executes quickly, regardless of the size of the input data.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the size of the input data. In algorithm analysis, it's common to represent space complexity using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.</p>
